This was my submission for the fourth assignment for CPS 350 at the University of Dayton.

The task of this assignment was to store the information of Ohio counties in a binary search tree, with the FIPS of each county used as keys. Requirements included:
  1. Adding the appropriate constuctors and auxiliary methods to the TreeNode and BST classes
  2. Implementing a pre-order traversal method
  3. Implementing an in-order traversal method
  4. Implementing methods to insert and delete counties
  5. Testing the code with a sample list of counties, and explaining why a county was deleted correctly.
